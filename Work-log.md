The instructions have outlined the first task, which involves fixing issues related to tagging articles. The problems and expected behaviors are detailed as follows:

**Current Behavior:** 
1. Tags are broken up into individual characters on the post.
2. New tags are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags" after a refresh.

**Expected Behavior:** 
1. Users can enter tags in a comma-separated list in the "tag" form field.
2. The values are split by commas and trimmed for whitespace.
3. Any tags that do not exist yet from the list are created and visible on the home page (after refresh).
4. Articles can be filtered based on the tags.

There is also a mention of an acceptance test, so it seems that there will be specific scenarios to validate the solution.

Let's continue reading to complete the understanding of Task 1 and find out if there are any additional tasks.

The instructions for Task 3 (Hard) outline the requirements to allow articles to have multiple authors, enabling collaborative editing. The specific details are as follows:

**Requirements:** 
- In the “edit” view for an article, add a new “Authors” section where authors can add a comma-separated list of authors (by email address).
- Authors cannot remove themselves from this list; an error message should be shown if they attempt to do so.
- In the feed, all the co-authors are displayed next to each other.
- In the article view page, all the co-authors are displayed one after the other.
- Once an author opens an article for editing, the article is locked until the author saves it, navigates away, or 5 minutes pass without any activity. No other authors can edit it during this time, and an error message is shown if they attempt to do so.

The acceptance test for Task 3 is also outlined.

Let's continue reading to complete the understanding of Task 3 and check for any additional information or tasks.

It seems that we have reached the end of the instructions document. We have successfully reviewed the entire content and have a clear understanding of the three tasks: 
1. **Task 1 (Easy):**  Fix the tags when a new post is created. 
2. **Task 2 (Medium):**  Create a Conduit Roster page with specific requirements. 
3. **Task 3 (Hard):**  Allow articles to have multiple authors with collaborative editing capabilities.

Each task has specific requirements and acceptance tests that we must consider in our implementation.

The next step is to obtain the codebase and start working on the tasks. Unfortunately, the instructions mentioned downloading the code from a specific link, but I do not have access to external resources in my environment. If you could provide the codebase, we can proceed with the tasks.

The codebase is divided into two main directories: `backend` and `frontend`. Additionally, there is a `README.md` file that may contain instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

We will need to look into both the backend and frontend parts of the codebase to implement and test the given tasks.

Let's first read the content of the `README.md` file to get an overview of the project and any specific instructions for setting up and running the code.

The `README.md` file provides an overview of the Conduit project and the instructions to set up and run the application. Here's a summary of the information: 
- **Technology Stack:**  The application consists of a NestJS backend and an Angular frontend, both written in TypeScript. 
- **Prerequisites:** 
- Docker or a locally running MySQL installation
- NodeJS 16+
- Code Editor (VSCode is recommended) 
- **Getting Started Instructions:**  
- Open `backend` and `frontend` sub-folders in the IDE. 
- Install backend and frontend dependencies using `yarn`.
- Start MySQL in docker or adjust the MySQL credentials in the configuration file. 
- Start the backend and frontend using `npm start`.
- Seed the database with initial data. 
- Access the UI at `http://localhost:4200` and log in with the provided credentials.

Given the nature of the tasks, we will need to explore both the frontend and backend code to make the necessary changes and run the acceptance tests.

Since I'm unable to execute Docker commands or run the frontend and backend services in my environment, we may need to focus on code analysis, modification, and testing logic that can be executed without running the full application stack.

Let's start by exploring the backend code to understand its structure and identify the relevant files for Task 1.

The backend directory contains configuration files, a `src` folder (likely containing the source code), and other typical files found in a Node.js project.

Let's explore the `src` folder to find the relevant files related to the tasks, particularly focusing on Task 1, which deals with fixing tags when a new post is created. We should look for files related to articles, posts, or tags.

The `src` folder in the backend directory contains several subdirectories and files that are likely related to different modules and functionalities of the application. Given that Task 1 involves fixing tags for articles, the `tag` and `article` directories are likely to contain the relevant code.

Let's explore the `tag` directory first to understand how tags are handled in the codebase. This will help us identify the changes needed to fix the issues described in Task 1.


Finished working

Show work



The `tag` directory contains several TypeScript files that likely define the structure, logic, and endpoints related to tags. Here's a brief description of each file: 
- `tag.interface.ts`: Likely defines the interface for a tag. 
- `tag.entity.ts`: Likely contains the entity definition for a tag, mapping it to the database. 
- `tag.module.ts`: The module file, which likely includes the dependencies and configuration related to tags. 
- `tag.service.ts`: Likely contains the service logic for handling tag-related operations. 
- `tag.controller.ts`: Likely contains the API endpoints related to tags.

Since Task 1 involves fixing how tags are handled when creating a new post, the `tag.service.ts` and `tag.controller.ts` files are likely to contain the relevant logic. Let's start by reading the contents of these files to understand how tags are currently handled and identify the necessary changes.

The `tag.service.ts` file defines the `TagService` class, which currently contains a single method, `findAll`. This method is responsible for fetching all the tags from the repository and returning them.

However, since Task 1 involves fixing issues related to the creation of tags when a new post is created, the relevant logic might be located in the article-related files rather than the tag-specific files.

Let's explore the `article` directory to find the relevant logic for handling the creation of articles and the associated tags.


Finished working

Show work



The `article` directory contains several TypeScript files related to articles, including: 
- `article.interface.ts`: Likely defines the interface for an article. 
- `article.entity.ts`: Contains the entity definition for an article, mapping it to the database. 
- `article.module.ts`: The module file, including dependencies and configuration related to articles. 
- `article.service.ts`: Contains the service logic for handling article-related operations. 
- `article.controller.ts`: Contains the API endpoints related to articles.

Since Task 1 is about fixing the tags when a new article is created, we'll likely need to examine both the `article.service.ts` and `article.controller.ts` files to understand the current behavior and identify the required changes.

Let's start by reading the contents of the `article.service.ts` file to understand the logic related to articles, particularly focusing on the creation of articles and handling of tags.

Show work



The `article.service.ts` file defines the `ArticleService` class, responsible for handling article-related operations. The first method we see is `findAll`, which fetches articles based on certain query parameters, including tags and authors.

Since Task 1 specifically deals with the creation of new articles and handling of tags, we'll need to look for methods responsible for creating articles within this file. Let's continue reading the file to identify the relevant logic for handling the creation of articles and associated tags.


Finished working

The code we've read so far mainly pertains to fetching articles, filtering them based on various query parameters, and returning the results. We still haven't encountered the logic related to creating new articles and handling tags.

Let's continue reading the `article.service.ts` file to find the relevant code for Task 1.
